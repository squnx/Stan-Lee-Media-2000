				In the event you download software from Stan Lee Media web sites, the software, including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and data accompanying the software (collectively, the "Software") are licensed to you by Stan Lee Media.
				Stan Lee Media does not transfer title to the Software to you.  You own the medium on which the Software is recorded, but Stan Lee Media retains full and complete title to the Software, and all intellectual property rights therein.

				<B>PRIVACY</B><BR><IMG SRC="/images/shim.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR>
				Stan Lee Media is very respectful about the privacy concerns of the visitors to its sites on the Internet.  As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors to its sites.  However, certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded by the standard operation of Stan Lee Media's Internet servers.
				This information is primarily used to provide an enhanced online experience for the visitor.  E-mail addresses and other personal identifiable data about visitors to this site are known to Stan Lee Media only when voluntarily submitted.
				Personal identifiable information that may be collected in connection with visitors voluntarily filling out contest entry forms or subscribing to newsletters is retained by Stan Lee Media.  This data in an aggregate form may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.
				We sometimes also use e-mail addresses and other personal identifiable information to contact visitors who communicate with us.  For example, we direct e-mail to visitors who provide us with their e-mail addresses for specific purposes such as receiving our e-mail newsletters or being notified if they have won one of our contests.
				Each e-mail newsletter always contains instruction on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter.<BR>
				<IMG SRC="/images/shim.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR>
				Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, phone number) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people.
				To the extent that any of our sites accessible through Stan Lee Media has additional practices, these practices will be explained at that site.<BR><A NAME="4"></A><BR>
				<B>POLICIES FOR KIDS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE)</B><BR><IMG SRC="/images/shim.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR>
				Stan Lee Media complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.  All Stan Lee Media sites display a clear and prominent link to this privacy policy.
				Personal information collected through registration includes the first and last name of the user, the user's e-mail address, the user's gender, date of birth, zip code, country of residence, chosen online nickname ("username"), and chosen online password, user's parent's e-mail address if user is under 13 years of age.
				Stan Lee Media does not require a user under 13 years of age to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation.
				<IMG SRC="/images/shim.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR>
				All registrants receive an e-mail confirming their Registration. In addition, when a user under 13 years of age registers, he/she is required to provide the e-mail address of his/her parent or guardian and that parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that Registration.
				Registered users under 13 years of age may participate in such activities upon Registration, unless their parent or guardian asks that their registration be invalidated.  The e-mail sent to the parent or guardian informs him/her of what information has been collected, and provides him/her with the opportunity to remove the registration of his/her child from the site.
				<IMG SRC="/images/shim.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR>
				A new e-mail will be sent to the parent or guardian if changes are made to the kinds of information that is collected from the user under 13 years of age; if changes are made to how the information collected from the user under 13 years of age is used; and/or if the information collected from the user under 13 years of age is offered to new and different third parties.<BR>
				<IMG SRC="/images/shim.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR>
				Parents or guardians may review their child's personal information, have their child's personal information deleted at any time, and refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information by following the directions outlined in the confirmatory email, or contacting us at mailto:customerservice@stanleemedia.com.<BR>
				<IMG SRC="/images/shim.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR>
				Although users under 13 years of age may be allowed to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a user wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parent or guardian identified in the initial registration process.  Publication of names, ages, or images for contest winners under 13 years of age require parental or guardian consent.<BR>
				<IMG SRC="/images/shim.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5"><BR>
				If Stan Lee Media discovers that a user about who it has collected information from has misrepresented his or her age and is in fact under age 13, or that a user under 13 years of age has disclosed personal information on its bulletin boards or in any other public forum on its site, Stan Lee Media will comply with the Federal Trade Commission regulations under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.<BR><A NAME="5"></A><BR>
